## 1. Summary

This is an intermediate report on the capstone project, which aims to create
some system that accelerates user input e.g. on mobile devices by offering 
options as the next word while the user is typing. I expect this project to
finish with a ground-up prototype of a realistic predictive engine.

The language the solution works in is up to the student, I expect to choose the 
(I assume fairly typical) US English.

This search for a solution cannot aim to be exhaustive -- for instance using 
someone else's service is not really an option when demonstrating skills, however 
definitely is a possibility in reality.

The two most promising predictive strategies are covered here, namely

* using a vocabulary to predict words (i.e. predicting while ignoring the context)
* leveraging the knowledge of a preceding word (using bigrams)

As it is also useful to verify/construct hypotheses using a smaller subset before 
expanding the scope of discussion, the examinations are restricted to two word
structures, longer ones may be considered at a later stage.

## 2. Introducing the data set

For this project, a set of 3 files was [provided](https://eventing.coursera.org/api/redirectStrict/Nj8snifhv3-FC2rzb11MgOcihhVx3nDwDOW4RX2Q7XQW7AHjp2xRhJK-Zq5FSWRHNbbzJoFzf0jHuBN4KvkLVA.PmAafTLQ4d5DoiLq5_FE0g.U7Pg_6RscXUwxpHwM4N7Ni_nYZwb6D6OEqwt7itM6wnk0xZTvIQCI3HUDhMv1tdgTYk4CWrqeka6qJD_NKelM9zZ6jkwBcBr_ndono6tkz-SxHo4TLk77SAyff12wdnjHKxcEqlp_Tj8GnYoBMxjBFZMZxdEt1pa8m-ll8c83mJYDTCNGHE4qYVBvoQzFvvtDIICjTcrx212Y9L3ghN-JlGbRQjIv_6rLKDzoY1_AQDuGOnQT89M4NmAuqLAwFzos-iUin2ZTAMaSC9CoCr0HcycooFVg0onhR8BJoyLFiMrSY06nsiLcF9vzulvFc6kJ32cFvQae5bMPy9Mhtd1j-YpyK8waf0FkDnlzPXwbnD819qJFRlDGANV86dE9iGNc1xmTr-D7slkf6z59Kg_pi0wST7sn50FZaGUO5lLDn0). 
These encompass a large corpus of (US) English words, containing hundreds of 
megabytes of data. The sources are summarized below based on subsamples. 
Subsampling allows for the processing to take place quickly despite the sheer 
size of the data (and R's notoriously bad reputation at scaling up to large data 
sets).

For the sake of exploration, numbers and punctuations have been consistently 
removed. This may need reconsideration before the final prototype.

```{r "data processing", cache=TRUE}
data.path  = "../input/en_US/"
file.names = dir(data.path)
file.paths = file.path(data.path, file.names)
sizes = file.size(file.paths)

# prepare for reproducible random subsampling
set.seed(0)
# read up the files
lines = rep(NA, 3)
line.counts = rep(NA, 3)
sample.lines = c(3000, 3000 * 1.05, 9000)
for(i in 1:3) {
  text = readLines(file.paths[i], -1)
  line.counts[i] = length(text)
  # use a small, random sample of the data as 
  # text manipulation gets slow otherwise
  is.selected = sample(x = length(text), size = sample.lines[i])
  text = text[is.selected]
  # the text will be more useful as a single character
  text = paste0(text, collapse = " ")
  
  lines[i] = text
}

# prepare for text mining
corp = Corpus(VectorSource(lines))
inspect(corp)

cl.corp = tm_map(corp, stripWhitespace)
cl.corp = tm_map(cl.corp, content_transformer(tolower))
cl.corp = tm_map(cl.corp, removePunctuation)
cl.corp = tm_map(cl.corp, removeNumbers)
cl.corp = tm_map(cl.corp, stemDocument)
# currently stopwords are not removed
# cl.corp = tm_map(cl.corp, removeWords, stopwords("english"))
dtm = DocumentTermMatrix(cl.corp)

rm(corp)
rm(lines)
```

```{r "data set summary table"}

full.to.sample = line.counts / sample.lines

kable(
  caption = "Data set summary table (words are stemmed)",
  align = c("l", "r", "r", "r", "r", "r", "r"),
  col.names = c("File", "File Size (MB)", "Lines (k)", 
                "Word Count (est. total, k)", "Sampling Ratio", 
                "Word Count (sample)",
                "Unique Words (sample)"),
  data.frame(file.names, 
             round(sizes / 1024 / 1024, digits = 2),
             round(line.counts / 1000),
             round(apply(as.matrix(dtm), MARGIN = 1, FUN = sum)
                   * full.to.sample / 1000),
             sprintf("%.2f %%", 1 / full.to.sample * 100),
             apply(as.matrix(dtm), MARGIN = 1, FUN = sum),
             apply(as.matrix(dtm), MARGIN = 1, FUN = function(x) sum(x != 0)))
)
```

## 3. Exploratory analysis of words

### 3.1. Word distribution

Based on this table the diversity of the language seems to be the highest in the
news corpus, while Twitter messages and blog posts possibly repeat somewhat more 
of the phrases. Nevertheless, there seems no huge difference there.

[Zipf's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf's_law) states that the words 
are likely to follow a distribution of a negative power 
$\text{(}P(w_i) = c w_i ^ p;\text{ for some }c, p \in R, p < -1\text{)}$, 
thus the distribution would appear linear on a lin-log scale.

```{r "Zipf's law", fig.width=7, fig.height=4, fig.align="center"}
zipf.freqs = as.matrix(dtm)
dtm.col.total = 
  zipf.freqs[1, ] + 
  zipf.freqs[2, ] + 
  zipf.freqs[3, ] # likely to be faster than apply()

for(i in 1:nrow(zipf.freqs)) {
  zipf.freqs[i, ] = sort(zipf.freqs[i, ], decreasing = TRUE)
}
dtm.col.total = sort(dtm.col.total, decreasing = TRUE)

zipf.freqs = log10(zipf.freqs)
dtm.col.total = log10(dtm.col.total)

plot(main = "Distribution of word frequency",
     ylab = "Log of occurrences",
     xlab = "Word rank",
     xlim = c(1, length(zipf.freqs)),
     zipf.freqs[1, ], col = "red", type = "l")

lines(zipf.freqs[2, ], col = "green")
lines(zipf.freqs[3, ], col = "blue")
lines(dtm.col.total, col = "black")

plot(main = "Frequency distribution of top ranked words",
     ylab = "Log of occurrences",
     xlab = "Word rank",
     xlim = c(1, length(zipf.freqs) / 100),
     zipf.freqs[1, ], col = "red", type = "l")

lines(zipf.freqs[2, ], col = "green")
lines(zipf.freqs[3, ], col = "blue")
lines(dtm.col.total, col = "black")
```

While the charts do not clearly agree with this formula, words ranked below 
10000 apparently occur very rarely, once in the samples.
This potentially enables focusing on a relevant subset of a whole corpora later
on, which is useful if only a smaller subset of e.g. a dictionary or data set 
needs to be distributed over to a potentially less capable mobile device.

The feasibility of this can be confirmed by looking at how many occurrences some 
top words account for in total.

```{r "occurrences by top words", fig.width=7, fig.height=4, fig.align="center"}
plot.occurrence.chart = function(freqs, main, pos.2 = 4) {
  freqs = sort(freqs, decreasing = TRUE)
  total.words = sum(freqs)
  cumsum.freqs = cumsum(freqs)
  
  plot(main = main,
       xlab = "Last rank included",
       ylab = "Occurrences (%)",
       xlim = c(1, length(cumsum.freqs)),
       cumsum.freqs / total.words * 100, 
       type = "l",
       col = "darkgrey")
  abline(a = c(90, 0), col = "grey", lty = 2)
  rank.90.perc = min(which(cumsum.freqs > total.words * 0.9))
  abline(v = rank.90.perc, col = "grey", lty = 2)
  text(x = rank.90.perc, y = 90, pos = pos.2,
       sprintf("90%% of the text samples is covered\nby the top %d", rank.90.perc))
  
  rank.50.perc = min(which(cumsum.freqs > total.words * 0.5))
  abline(a = c(50, 0), col = "grey", lty = 3)
  abline(v = rank.50.perc, col = "grey", lty = 3)
  text(x = rank.50.perc, y = 50, pos = 4,
       sprintf("50%% of the text samples is covered\nby the top %d", rank.50.perc))
  
  return(list(rank.50.perc = rank.50.perc, rank.90.perc = rank.90.perc))
}

freqs = as.matrix(dtm)
freqs = freqs[1, ] + freqs[2, ] + freqs[3, ]
freq.quantiles = 
  plot.occurrence.chart(freqs, "Occurrences covered by top n (stemmed) words")

```

This figure confirms that a relatively small proportion 
(`r round(100 * freq.quantiles$rank.90.perc/length(freqs), 2)` % in the sample) 
suffices to cover 9 out of 10 words the user may type in. If we are pleased with 
having only 50% of the words covered, a handful of words 
(`r round(100 * freq.quantiles$rank.50.perc/length(freqs), 2)` %) will suffice.

The top words look promising, although are expected to be stopwords:

```{r}
library(stringi)

df.dtm = t(as.matrix(dtm))
df.dtm = cbind(df.dtm[, 1] + df.dtm[, 2] + df.dtm[, 3], df.dtm)
df.dtm = 
  data.frame(
#    failed to make kable display backslashes in HTML
#    raw = gsub("[\\]", "\\\\\\", stri_escape_unicode(rownames(df.dtm))),

    raw = gsub("[\\]", " ", stri_escape_unicode(rownames(df.dtm))),
    df.dtm
  )
colnames(df.dtm) = c("Raw", "Total", "occ1", "occ2", "occ3") 

kable(x = head(df.dtm[order(df.dtm$Total, decreasing = TRUE), ], 20), 
      caption = "Most frequent words", 
      col.names = c("Raw", "Total", file.names))
```

### 3.2. Further cleaning of the data

The vocabulary analyzed currently contains things that may be unnecessary or 
unwanted among the predictions. These may include vulgar/foreign expressions, 
emoticons, etc. alongside the rarer ones.

One way to improve on this is restricting our examinations to the aforementioned
most frequent minority of the text elements.

As an example, the first elements contain emoticons:

```{r "words in doc. term. matrix"}
kable(
  col.names = c("Raw", "Total", "Freq.1", "Freq.2", "Freq.3"),
  x = head(df.dtm, 10)
)
```

Unless creating a context-specific system (which can be later made a goal), to
initially stay with a simpler approach, the data set can also be restricted to 
those linguistic units which appear in all 3 of the corpora. This can be useful 
since some phrases seem to rarely appear outside/within certain contexts.

This would have already filtered out the aforementioned problematic first 
entries. Swearwords also seem very unfrequent in blog entries. However, the lack
of presence in each of the documents can be due to the sparsity of the sampling.

### 3.3. Leveraging stemming - 2 phases?

Also while it wasn't heavily emphasized, the words were considered in a stemmed 
form. This made a smaller sample denser on the distribution side thus 
helping the analysis, but also can allow for an initial narrowing down of the 
choices with a two-phase prediction method. 
Offering the user a smaller subset: incomplete predictions can also speed entry
up. For example, after they typed "ac", and have been offered with and 
selected _academi_, they can be presented with likely endings of that stem, 
e.g. _academia_, _academic_ etc..

#### 3.3.1. "albuquerqu"

Some of the word stems, however, may have an unequivocal continuation (at least
concluding from the available corpora). It means in that case the stem is 
likely to be unnecessarily offered. An example identified is _albuquerqu_ .

### 3.4. About changes over time

Languages change continuously and good prediction algorithms should reflect
their nature. One thing to note is a static data set cannot adhere to this.

#### 3.4.1. Adaptive data sets

One way to address this is adapting the data set continuously along with the
experienced user input. This also allows to adapt to the user-specific 
vocabulary.

Another way is to distribute data set updates e.g. via the web.

#### 3.4.2. Choice of core vocabulary

On another hand, when looking for the core set of expressions to wrap up in a
conveniently small package, being time-tested could form a basis for preference.
Stemming can also help here, or coincide with this filter - words from time to 
time get constructed from existing stems, and stems are more persistent and 
constant elements of a language.

### 3.5. Casing

As leading words of sentences are capitalized they should be treated case 
insensitively (i.e. as if their casing was unknown) when harvesting data, or 
completely ignored.

## 4. Exploring more complex structures

### 4.1. Bigrams

For prediction, it can be useful to know whether bigrams, which are two-word 
sequences in a text, have a certain uneven distribution. Intiuitively this is
very likely to happen.

The words most likely to follow a given one, _w_, may be the ones to display at 
the top of a list of suggestions once _w_ has been entered. These are, in other
words, the ones with the highest probability conditional on being preceded by 
_w_.

```{r "bigram generation", cache=TRUE, fig.width=7, fig.height=4, fig.align="center"}
# based on http://tm.r-forge.r-project.org/faq.html
BigramTokenizer <-
  function(x)
    unlist(lapply(ngrams(words(x), 2), paste, collapse = " "), use.names = FALSE)

dtm.2 <- TermDocumentMatrix(cl.corp, control = list(tokenize = BigramTokenizer))

df.dtm.2 = as.matrix(dtm.2)
df.dtm.2 = cbind(df.dtm.2[, 1] + df.dtm.2[, 2] + df.dtm.2[, 3], df.dtm.2)
colnames(df.dtm.2) <- c("total", "occ1", "occ2", "occ3")
df.dtm.2 = as.data.frame(df.dtm.2)
df.dtm.2 = df.dtm.2[order(df.dtm.2$total, decreasing = TRUE), ]
plot(log(df.dtm.2$total), type = "l", col = "darkgrey",
     xlim = c(1, 200),
     ylab = "Log of occurrences", xlab = "Rank",
     main = "Distribution of bigrams in the samples by rank")
```

The distribution is very similar to that of the words. 

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=4, fig.align="center"}
quantiles = 
  plot.occurrence.chart(df.dtm.2$total, 
                        "Occurrences covered by top n (stemmed) bigrams",
                        pos.2 = 2)
```

Since stopword removal is not part of the data processing, the top bigrams are 
expected expected to contain these:

```{r}
kable(x = head(df.dtm.2, 20), caption = "Most frequent bigrams", 
      col.names = c("Total", file.names))
```

## 5. Summary

### 5.1. "Questions to consider"

The set of questions to consider was:

* "1. Some words are more frequent than others - what are the distributions of word frequencies?"
* "2. What are the frequencies of 2-grams and 3-grams in the dataset?"
* "3. How many unique words do you need in a frequency sorted dictionary to cover 50% of all word instances in the language? 90%?"
* "4. How do you evaluate how many of the words come from foreign languages?"
* "5. Can you think of a way to increase the coverage -- identifying words that may not be in the corpora or using a smaller number of words in the dictionary to cover the same number of phrases?"

Question 1-3 have been addressed above.

#### 5.1.1. Question 4.
#### How do you evaluate how many of the words come from foreign languages?”

Some things cannot be detected. Certain words concide in terms of spelling, yet
mean different things in different languages. Some are as easy as filtering out 
Unicode characters. I expect there are strategies but no 100% accurate solutions
for this.

In short, at least one easy step to identify such words is to look out for 
Unicode characters - today's English words do not contain these.

Another good option is to obtain an English dictionary/thesaurus and verify 
against them, probably there are some freely avaialble ones out there.

#### 5.1.2. Question 5.
#### "Can you think of a way to increase the coverage..."

Categorizing the word endings, i.e. those which suffix the stems, may put the 
words into such groups that the likely continuations can be concluded from them.
In this case, the words can be continued with the ending of some other word 
which belongs to the same group.
This may not need to happen in the two phases mentioned above - a small set of
choices implies no need for this.

Knowing whether a word is a verb, adjective or noun can also be helpful. Certain
verbs are often followed by a likely subset of stopwords (e.g. "want to", 
"applies to", etc.). Such relationships are easier to evaluate using a 
non-stemmed dataset.

### 5.2. Closing words

Probably enough of the difficulties with the project have been outlined in the
above to start effectively working on it. Extracting the words, bigrams from
larger corpora, perhaps trigrams, addressing casing issues, potential 
performance problems (for not necessarily pure R solutions it should not be a 
problem to process some hundreds of megabytes of data), filtering words, 
researching dictionaries, restricting suggestions are plenty of tasks to proceed 
with.
